Display a list of optimized Twitter headlines for each blog-posts. Increase your Twitter retweets % and inbound traffic. 

== Description ==
MaxRetweet is a Twitter plugin that let you manually add multiple optimized Twitter headlines you like to a WordPress blog. This provides your readers the option to re-post your content with multiple titles while still letting you customize it exactly the way you’d like.

First, you install and activate the plugin, which requires little or no configuration needed. Then, visit each of the blog post you want to add the optimized Twitter headlines-in 'edit mode', below the 'published post' you will find "MaxRetweet Meta Box" where the plugin will let you add your optimized Twitter, one by one.

**Bonus:** Unlike other Twitter plugins for WordPress, this plugin helps you increase your Twitter retweets % & improve your inbound traffic. So from here your content will be retweeted at different times and different headlines, which is a great way to improve your engagement, reach and drive traffic back to your own site.

This plugin requires PHP 5, MySQL 4.1, and WordPress 3.3 or greater. See the [FAQs](http://wordpress.org/plugins/maxretweet/faq/) for answers to common questions.
